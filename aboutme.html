             <h2>My Background</h2>

             <p>
                 Graduating college with my bachelor's in marketing seemed like a smart decision at the time because
                 i figured marketing will always be around but unfortunetly, i just am not happy with my current career path.
                 I have always been interested in coding and I would play around with coding apps and coding games to help fuel my hobby.
                 I decided recently that it is time for me to turn that free time hobby into my full time career.

            <h2>Lastly, My Goal</h2>
            <p>My goal with this class is to become very comfortable with coding and computers to get to a point 
                where i can find a job that will enjoy. Obviously, my main goal is to make money but I also want to be happy
                with the work I do. I have my eyes set on a few companies i would absolutely love to work for and with but 
                i know as of right now I am not ready for that. So, I will continue to learn with Quickstart and practice every
                chance i get. As well as, i have been listening to a few computer engineering podcats that have been giving me 
                some advice and tips on how to better understand this field.
